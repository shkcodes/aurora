A Twitter client developed using Jetpack Compose. I started working on it in April - back before Compose hit 1.0. After almost two months, I noticed that keeping up with the new releases of Compose and updating depedencies was taking more time & effort than I would have liked. Then there was also the fact that Compose was not mature enough back then for me to implement all the features that I had in mind (shared element transitions for e.g.). So I finally decided to ditch Compose and go back to xml and view based development. With that being said, it was a really fun learning experience and I absolutely love the way we write code in Compose.

The video below shows how far I came using Compose (code available in the main branch). Further development of the app took place on the develop branch.

## Building the app

You will need to add your `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`, `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`, `TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET` & `TWITTER_CALLBACK_URL` to environment variables.
